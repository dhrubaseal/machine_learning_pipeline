## Installation

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage

The project consists of several scripts that perform different steps of the machine learning workflow. Here's how to use them:

1. **Data Collection**: Use the `data_collection.py` script to load data for the project.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data using the `data_preprocessing.py` script.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features using the `feature_engineering.py` script.

4. **Model Selection**: Choose and configure the machine learning model using the `model_selection.py` script.

5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model with the preprocessed data using the `model_training.py` script.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the `model_evaluation.py` script.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters of the model using the `hyperparameter_tuning.py` script.

8. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using the `model_deployment.py` script.

For detailed instructions on each step, refer to the documentation in the respective script files.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `data_collection.py`: Script for loading data.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for preprocessing data.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Script for feature engineering.
- `model_selection.py`: Script for selecting a machine learning model.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating the model.
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: Script for hyperparameter tuning.
- `model_deployment.py`: Script for deploying the trained model.

- `README.md`: Documentation file (you are here).
- `requirements.txt`: File containing project dependencies.

## Documentation

For more information on each script and how to use them, refer to the docstrings and comments in the script files. Additionally, check the documentation in the README.md file and the documentation files in the `docs` directory (if available).

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository: `git commit -m "Description of changes"` and `git push origin feature-name`.
4. Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.
5. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
